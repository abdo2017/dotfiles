# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This collection includes my personal configuration files for various tools and environments, designed to streamline my workflow across Linux, macOS, or Windows systems. Feel free to explore, use, or adapt these configurations for your own setup. However, use them at your own risk, as they are tailored to my preferences and may require adjustments for your environment.

## Included Dotfiles

Below is a list of the configuration files included in this repository:

- `.bashrc`: Bash shell configuration with aliases, functions, and environment variables.
- `.zshrc`: Zsh shell configuration, including Oh My Zsh settings and custom plugins.
- `.vimrc`: Vim editor configuration with key mappings, plugins, and syntax highlighting.
- `.gitconfig`: Git configuration for user details, aliases, and default behaviors.
